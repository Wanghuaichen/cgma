This test reads in a geometry file (two bricks overlapping a bit by a
corner), tests them for intersection, imprints and merges them.  The
warnings occur because of the overlap, which results in surfaces with
normals in the same direction being merged (which indicates
overlapping geometry).

The output of this test should look something like this:

$ ./mergechk merge.sat
